# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript and Vite for development
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a dark theme featuring neon accents (blue/purple color scheme)
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form validation

## Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints for appointment management
- **Development**: Hot module replacement with Vite integration

## Database Schema
The application uses two main tables:
- **programari**: Stores appointment data including patient information, appointment datetime, selected service, status, and optional messages
- **users**: Admin user authentication system

Key features:
- Appointment status tracking (pending, confirmed, rescheduled, completed, cancelled)
- Service selection for each appointment (Tratamente Generale, Estetica DentarÄƒ, Implantologie, etc.)
- UUID primary keys for all entities
- Timestamp tracking for created dates

## Authentication & Authorization
- Simple username/password authentication for admin access
- Session-based authentication (infrastructure present via connect-pg-simple)
- Admin-only access to appointment management features

## UI/UX Design Patterns
- **Glass Morphism**: Transparent cards and modals with blur effects
- **Parallax Scrolling**: Background images with depth sensation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints
- **Modern Animations**: Fade-in effects, hover transitions, and micro-interactions
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation

## Business Logic
- Appointment booking system with 30-minute time slots (9:00-17:00)
- Admin dashboard for appointment management including status updates
- Direct phone dialing functionality from admin panel
- One-click appointment confirmation with visual feedback
- Admin panel appointment booking capability
- Export functionality for appointment data
